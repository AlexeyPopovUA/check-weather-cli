# If you should deliver this application to users, what should you do?

* Find out what actually users need :)
* Automation of build, linting, testing, versioning and distribution
* Better coverage with integration and unit tests 
* API keys management (distribute with package or require configuring on consumer side)
* Proper error handling (readable, user friendly, debug mode and logging levels)
* Input fields validation and question loops (no instant failures for prompt cases)
* Language detection and usage with services
* Clear parameters naming
* Well thought use cases (automatic geolocation, skipping questions etc.)
* Feedback channels and user research
* Advertisements :)
