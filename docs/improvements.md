# What could be done to improve the application?

* All technical points from [distribution preparation article](/docs/distribution-preparation.md)
* Better names for the cli flags
* Better bundling solution and source maps for nodejs build
* Logging with levels
* Multiple extra output formats: json file, json output, csv file etc.
* Better linting rules (current ones were taken from the Proton repo with React projects)
* Better solution for args parsing (currently 2 libs are used: yargs and inquirer)
